Intrusion Detection System Using Deep Q-Network (DQN)
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting network attacks using the NSL-KDD dataset. The model leverages reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
âœ” Uses Deep Q-Network (DQN) for intrusion detection.
âœ” Preprocesses categorical and numerical network traffic data.
âœ” Applies feature scaling and selection to enhance model efficiency.
âœ” Trained on NSL-KDD dataset with an accuracy of 60.16%.
âœ” Supports real-time testing of network packets.
